# BCG-X-AI-Chatbot

This project was completed as part of the **BCG X GenAI Simulation**, where the goal was to develop an **AI-powered financial chatbot** to interpret and present financial insights using real-world company data.

## 📌 Project Overview

The project was divided into two major tasks:

### ✅ Task 1: Financial Data Extraction & Analysis
- Extracted key financial data (2020–2022) from **10-K reports** of Microsoft, Apple, and Tesla.
- Metrics analyzed: **Total Revenue**, **Net Income**, **Total Assets**, **Total Liabilities**, **Cash Flow from Operations**.
- Used **Python (Pandas)** in a **Jupyter Notebook** to identify year-over-year trends and insights.

### ✅ Task 2: AI Chatbot Development
- Developed a **rule-based chatbot** in Python.
- The chatbot responds to predefined financial queries, such as:
  - "What is the total revenue?"
  - "What is the net income of Apple in 2022?"
  - "How much was Tesla’s cash flow from operations?"
- Financial data is pulled from a structured **CSV file**.
